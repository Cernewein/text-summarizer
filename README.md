# text-summarizer
We provide here some of the main obtained results and not in a Jupyter Notebook since the most meaningful results are shown in here and running a model inside of a notebook, is impossible due to its size and the size of the dataset.

## Installation
In order to install the needed packages run:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
However in order to be able to compute the ROUGE score you will need to install it (instructions can be found [here](https://github.com/bheinzerling/pyrouge)).

## Data 
To get the data, download the `CNN_STORIES_TOKENIZED` and `DM_STORIES_TOKENIZED` from [here](https://github.com/JafferWilson/Process-Data-of-CNN-DailyMail). Then prepare the data by running `preprocess_data.py`.

The `vocab` file used can be downloaded [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0BzQ6rtO2VN95a0c3TlZCWkl3aU0/view).

## Models
The pointer generator can be found in the file `model.py`. However, note that the model is composed of an encoder and decoder that are then used inside the object `PointerGenerator`.
